## About

The `/token` endpoint is thoroughly documented in [OpenID Connect Core, chapter 3.1.3](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthorizationEndpoint)

## Request

The client requests a token by passing the authorization grant (normally a 'code' value) to the /token endpoint.

There are different parameters available for the request, depending on grant type and client authentication method.   The following always apply:

| Parameter  | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Http method | POST |
| Content-type | application/x-www-form-urlencoded |



### Request parameters when using `code` grant

The following request attributes are available when using the authorization code grant

| Attribute  | Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| client_id | required | The identifier of the client  |
| grant_type | required | Type of grant the client is sending, ie. `authorization_code` |
| code | required  | The authorization code received in the authorization response.  |
| redirect_uri | required | The desired redirect uri.  Must be the same value as was used in the corresponding authentication request. |
| code_verifier | recommended | The PKCE code verifier. Mandatory for public clients. |
| client_assertion_type | optional | If using certificate / asymmetric key for client authentication (recommended), this parameter must be set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`  |
| client_assertion   | optional   | A JWT identifing the client, mandatory if client_assertion_type is set  |


### Request parameters when using `JWT-bearer` grant

The following request attributes are available when using the authorization code grant

| Attribute  | Requirement | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| grant_type | required | Type of grant the client is sending, ie. `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`  |
| assertion   | optional   | The JWT grant  |

There is no need to perform client authenticion when using this grant, as the client is implicitly authenticated by the certificate in the JWT.

See [JWT grant](oidc_protocol_jwtgrant.html) for requirements for the JWT grant.


### Request parameters when using `refresh_token ` grant

TODO


### Client authentication

ID-porten supports four client authentication methods:

* client_secret_basic
* client_secret_post
* private_key_jwt
* none


#### Client authentication using client secret basic

A previously exchanged out-of-band static secret is used for standard HTTP bacic authentication header comprised of base64 encoded concatenation of client_id + colon + secret.

```
POST /token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic dGVzdF9ycF95dDI6cGFzc3dvcmQ=

grant_type=authorization_code&
  redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Feid-exttest.difi.no%2Fidporten-oidc-client%2Fauthorize%2Fresponse&
  code=1JzjKYcPh4MIPP9YWxRfL-IivWblfKdiRLJkZtJFMT0%3D
```


#### Client authentication using client secret post

A previously exchanged out-of-band static secret is used for authentication.  The secret is added as a claim `client_secret` in the JSON payload of the POST request.




#### Client authentication using JWT token

The client generates a JWT as specified in [RFC7523 chapter 2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523#section-2.2), and signs this using a valid business certificate conforming to [Rammeverk for autentisering og uavviselighet i elektronisk kommunikasjon med og i offentlig sektor](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/rammeverk-for-autentisering-og-uavviseli/id505958/).

The request is extended with the attributes 'client_assertion_type' and 'client_assertion', see above.

The 'sub' field of the JWT must be set equal to your client_id, otherwise the JWT itself is similar to [those used for JWT grant](oidc_protocol_jwtgrant.html).

#### Example:

```
POST /token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=authorization_code&
   code=n0esc3NRze7LTCu7iYzS6a5acc3f0ogp4&
   client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer&
   client_assertion=< jwt >
```

#### No client authentication

Mobile apps and single-page applications are clients which cannot protect a secret/certificate and thus should be pre-registered to use no client authentication.

Use of PKCE and the `state` parameter will be required when using no client authentication.

## Response

The response is a set of tokens and associated metadata, and will depend upon what was requested.

| Claim | Description|
| - |-|
|access_token   | An Oauth2 access token, either by reference or as a JWT depending on scopes requested and/or client registration |
|expires_in  | Seconds this access_token is valid   |
| id_token   | An OpenID Connect id_token. Only returned if 'openid' scope was requested.  |
| refresh_token  | Issued to confidential clients  |
| scope   | The list of scopes issued in the access token. Included for convenience only, and should not be trusted for access control decisions.  |

```



### The id_token

The id_token is the assertion of the authenticated user identity.  It tells you "who the user is", but not "what the user can access".

The id_token is a JWT structure, as documented in [OIDC Core, 3.1.6](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeIDToken).  The client MUST validate the id_token according to [OIDC Core, 3.1.7](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDTokenValidation).  

In addition, the client MUST validate that the security level (`acr`) is sufficiently high for the given service.

Example:
```
{
  "kid" : "mqT5A3LOSIHbpKrscb3EHGrr-WIFRfLdaqZ_5J9GR9s",
  "alg" : "RS256"
}
```

**id_token header claims**

| claim | verdi |
| --- | --- |
| kid | "Key identifier" - unique identifier for the key and certificate used by ID-porten. The public key and the certificate must be fetched from our .well-known endpoint. |
| alg | "algorithm" - algorithm used for signing the token. ID-porten only supports `RS256` (RSA-SHA256) |

**id_token body claims**


| claim | value |
| --- | --- |
| sub | "subject identifier" - an unique identifier for the authenticated user.  The value is *pairwise*, meaning a given client will always get the same value, whilst different clients do not get equal values for the same user.  |
| aud | "audience" - The client_id of the client receiving this id_token  |
| acr | "Authentication Context Class Reference" - The security level of assurance for the authentication. Possible values are `Level3` (i.e.  MinID was used) or `Level4` (other eIDs). The level must be validated by the client. |
| auth_time | Timestamp indicating when the authentication was performed.  |
| amr | "Authentication Method References" - Method of authentication. Possible values from ID-porten av  `Minid-PIN`, `Minid-OTC`, `Commfides`, `Buypass`, `BankID`, `BankID-mobil` or `eIDAS`. The available values may change over time. |
| iss | The identifier of ID-porten as can be verified on the [.well-known endpoint](oidc_func_wellknown.html)|
| pid | "Personidentifikator" - the Norwegian national ID number (f√∏dselsnummer/d-nummer) of the autenticated end user.   Not included if `no_pid` scope was requested or pre-registered on the client.  Also not included for machine-type tokens.|
| exp | Expire - Timestamp when this token should not be trusted any more.  |
| iat | Timestamp when this token was issued.  |
| jti | jwt id - unique identifer for a given token  |
| locale | The language selected by the user during the authentication in ID-porten |
| sid | session id - an unique identifier for end user session at ID-porten. May be needed when performing logout |
|at_hash| A hash of the access_token issued together with this id_token. The client may use this value to protect against access_token injections when using by-reference access tokens. |





### The access token


ID-porten issues two different types of access_tokens:


|Token type|Description|
|-|-|
|by reference| The token is just a string referencing the authorization inside ID-porten.  Such tokens must be validated towards the [/tokeninfo endpoint](oidc_protocol_tokeninfo.html).  By-reference tokens are good for privacy, as no personal data can be harvested by the client or in transit. |
|by value | The token is self-contained, meaning it contains all the relevant information about the authorization (end user, scope, timestamp etc.).  Such tokens are non-revokable and should have a short lifetime |


#### "By value" / self-contained access token

The token is a JWT with the following structure:

**Access tokenets header:**

| claim | verdi |
| --- | --- |
| kid | "Key identifier" - unique identifier for the key and certificate used by ID-porten. The public key and the certificate must be fetched from our .well-known endpoint. |
| alg | "algorithm" - algorithm used for signing the token. ID-porten only supports `RS256` (RSA-SHA256) |



**Access token body:**

| claim | value | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sub | "subject identifier" - an unique identifier for the authenticated user.  The value is *pairwise*, meaning a given client will always get the same value, whilst different clients do not get equal values for the same user.  |
| aud   |  The indended audience for token.  Normally the Oauth2 'issuer' URL of the Resource Server / API. Some Resource Servers require audience-restricted tokens, and the actual values to used must be exchanged out-of-band.  ID-porten will set the string value `unspecified` if no audience-restricted token was requested by the client.   See [Oauth2 Resource Indicators](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-resource-indicators-05) |  `https://api.examples.com/users`|
| client_id | The client_id of the client who received this token. Note that client_ids should in general not be used for access control. |
| client_orgno | The organization number of the client. Present for legacy reasons, but note that using consumer/supplier claims is recommended for access control decisions by the Resource Server, as they are unambiguous. |
| consumer | The organization number, in ISO6523 notation, of the organization who is the legal consumer  of the token/API.  This value is always present.  In most cases, this organization will also be the Data Controller according to the GDPR. | <code>"consumer": {<br/>&nbsp;"Identifier": {<br/>&nbsp;"Authority": "iso6523-actorid-upis",<br/>&nbsp;"ID": "9908:910075918"&nbsp;<br>}&nbsp;}</code> |
| supplier | The organization number, in ISO6523 notation, of the optional organization which the `consumer` has delegated to act on its behalf regarding the API consumption.  In most cases, this is a Data Processor.|
| delegation_source   |  The Oauth2 *issuer* value of the legal authority where the `consumer` organization performed delegation of a given API access (ie: scope)  to the `supplier` organization |
| scope | A list of scopes the access_token is bound to.  Note that the End User may not grant access to all scopes requested.  |
| pid | "Personidentifikator" - the Norwegian national ID number (f√∏dselsnummer/d-nummer) of the autenticated end user.   Not included if `no_pid` scope was requested or pre-registered on the client.  Also not included for machine-type tokens.|
| token_type | Type of token. Only `Bearer` supported. |
| iss | The identifier of ID-porten as can be verified on the [.well-known endpoint](oidc_func_wellknown.html)|
| exp | Expire - Timestamp when this token should not be trusted any more.  |
| iat | Timestamp when this token was issued.  |
| jti | jwt id - unique identifer for a given token  |


#### Access token validation

**The client and resource server MUST validate all responses from ID-porten according to the OIDC and Oauth2 standards as well as  practice recommendations from the IETF.**

Access tokens must always be validated by the Resource Server / API before granting access. Clients should normally just pass the access token along to the resource server without any processing of it, however if any processing is performed, clients must also perform such validation.

The following references are vital:
* [RFC6819: Oauth2 threat model](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819)
* [RFC8252: OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252)
* [Draft RFC: OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps-03)
* [Draft RFC: OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-security-topics-13)

Developers integrating towards ID-porten / Maskinporten are expected to know these documents and apply them in their risk assessments. Our documention will not re-iterate the recommendations in the above documents, but overall we would like to hightlight:

* **Use a certified / well recognized IAM-product or OIDC library for the integration**
* **Keep secrets / certificates safe to avoid getting your organization  impersonated**
