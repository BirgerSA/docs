*Updated: 02.06.2020*

ELMA provides open datasets containing information about participants and what profiles each participant is registered with.

### Important note on use
NB! These datasets must not be used to check if a given norwegian organization is registered in PEPPOL or what documents an organization can receive. This should be done via a lookup via the SML (Service Metadata Locator).

Previously, ELMA was the only PEPPOL SMP where norwegian organizations were registered. This is no longer the case. A norwegian organization may be registered to an SMP which is not ELMA. A lookup only in ELMA is no longer a valid way to lookup norwegian organizations in PEPPOL.

It is also possible to lookup organizations via PEPPOL Directory. It is currently not mandatory for SMPs to publish information to PEPPOL Directory, so the list there is not complete.
